# Restaurant Management System

# Assumptions:
*only customer registers the manager has fixed 
          username:manager
          password:manager123
*no constraint on any user detail(no domain constraints)
*the restaurant contains infinite amount of each item on the menu
*there are two statuses for order If it is a takeaway-processing,delivered
*there are two statuses for order If it is a homedelivery-out for delivery,delivered
*The agents are automatically assigned based on the availability (id starts from 2)
*no agent for takeaway
*there are 5 agents for this restaurant
*if an order comes when all 5 agents are occupied then the order istaken but it will wait (time left=N/A)


## Overview
This project is a Restaurant Management System that allows customers to place orders, managers to view and manage orders, and delivery agents to handle deliveries. The system uses SQLite for the database and Python for the backend logic.

## Setup Instructions
**Manually add src/ to Pythonâ€™s path:sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../src')))
(add this on top of the test.py)

**delete if the database already exists
## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command:
```sh
python3 restaurant_management.py
```

## Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s testcases

```

## Test Cases
The test cases cover the following functionalities:
- **User registration and login:**
  - `test_register_user`: Tests if a new user can be registered.
  - `test_register_user_existing_username`: Tests if registering with an existing username raises an error.
  - `test_login`: Tests if a user can log in with valid credentials.
  - `test_login_invalid_credentials`: Tests if logging in with invalid credentials returns `None`.

- **Placing orders:**
  - `test_place_order`: Tests if an order can be placed successfully.
  - `test_place_order_empty_items`: Tests if placing an order with empty items raises a `ValueError`.

- **Viewing order status and history:**
  - `test_view_order_status`: Tests if the order status can be viewed.
  - `test_view_order_history`: Tests if the order history can be viewed.

- **Viewing incoming orders and delivery agents:**
  - `test_view_incoming_orders`: Tests if incoming orders can be viewed by the manager.
  - `test_view_delivery_agents`: Tests if delivery agents can be viewed by the manager.

- **Assigning delivery agents and updating order statuses:**
  - `test_view_assigned_orders`: Tests if assigned orders can be viewed by the delivery agent.
  - `test_update_order_statuses`: Tests if order statuses can be updated.
  - `test_assign_delivery_agent`: Tests if a delivery agent can be assigned to an order.

- **Calculating estimated preparation and delivery times:**
  - `test_calculate_estimated_time`: Tests if the estimated preparation and delivery times can be calculated for home delivery.
  - `test_calculate_estimated_time_takeaway`: Tests if the estimated preparation time can be calculated for takeaway.

Each test case ensures that the respective functionality works as expected and handles edge cases appropriately.

## Notes
- The database is initialized with default menu items, an admin user, a manager, and delivery agents.
- The system uses threading to update order statuses periodically.
- The application uses the `tabulate` library to display data in a tabular format.
